 * Standâ€‘alone authentication stub
 *
 * The original project integrated with Replit's OIDC provider via Passport.js.
 * That workflow requires environment variables such as `REPLIT_DOMAINS`,
 * `REPL_ID`, `SESSION_SECRET` and a Postgres session store. None of these
 * dependencies exist in a generic Node environment, and for a local preview
 * they're unnecessary. To provide a frictionless demo, this module exports
 * replacements for `setupAuth` and `isAuthenticated` that simply attach a
 * dummy user to each request and allow all requests to proceed.

 * return `undefined`, causing the frontend to remain on the landing page.
